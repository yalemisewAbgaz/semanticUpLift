This repository contains an ongoing work. The URIs are only for experimental purpose and permanent Uris will be provided soon.This work contains:
1. the ontology for lexical data collection and analysis stage
2. semantic data (RDf) of questionnaires and questions of the dboe@ema database. 
The semantic up-lift is done using R2RML and the mapping rule in ttl format is included. 
The generated data is stored in a ttl format. Any exploration or interpretation of the data will benefit from the ontology (OLDCA>owl) and all entities and relations are defined in it. 

A textual description of the ontology is also included in Data_Modelling_SpecificationD.dox)
